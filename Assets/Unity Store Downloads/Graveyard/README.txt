Hey, thanks for using Blink Art Assets!

1. The water will only work in built in
2. If you do not use the demo scene and want to save some disk space, delete DEMO_Graveyard folder
3. Install post processing if you want the same visuals as on the video/screenshots

If you have any question, let me know!
Enjoy
